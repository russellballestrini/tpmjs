# TPMJS — The NPM for AI Tools

> TPMJS is an open tool registry and platform for discovering, publishing, and executing AI agent tools from npm. Any npm package with the `tpmjs` keyword is automatically discovered and made available. Tools use the Vercel AI SDK `tool()` pattern and work with Claude, GPT, LangChain, and any MCP-compatible client. The platform provides collections for organizing tools, custom agents with multi-provider support, scenario testing, living skills documentation, and a unified MCP endpoint.
