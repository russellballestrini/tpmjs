            TPMJS is a <strong>developer platform</strong> for AI tools. The design reflects this
            through industrial aesthetics: sharp edges, technical typography, and a muted palette
            with copper as the signal color.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sans text-foreground-secondary leading-relaxed">
            Unlike consumer products that aim for delight, TPMJS aims for
            <strong> efficiency and trust</strong>. Users should feel confident that the interface
            will behave predictably and help them accomplish tasks quickly.
